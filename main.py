# Step 1: Create an Animal base class
# the class should support "name" and "year_discovered" properties


# Step 2: Create a Mamal class that inherits from your Animal base class
# be sure to create the class variables move, breathe and reproduce and assign
# the values descirbed in the README for this animal type.


# Step 3: Create a Bird class and that inherits from your Animal base class
# be sure to create the class variables move, breathe and reproduce and assign
# the values descirbed in the README for this animal type.


# Step 4: Create a Fish class that inherits from your Animal base class
# be sure to create the class variables move, breathe and reproduce and assign
# the values descirbed in the README for this animal type.
